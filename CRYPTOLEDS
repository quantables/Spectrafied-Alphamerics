Spectrafied Alphamerics refers to a quantum secure channel, which facilitates the exchange of uneavesdroppable, non-interceptable, non-tamperable data in the form of quantacryption. Quantacrypted electromagnetic wavelengths, to establish a quantum shared key between two parties without a third party (Eve).

Quantacryption-Encrypted Light, Physical-Cryptoled, and Visual-Cortical Challenge are combined to create a unique cryptographic wavelength or quantum visible field, space-time. The quantum visible field defines the optimum dicernible angle for decrypting spectrafied alphamerical data emitted from a CRYPTOLED display. The dicernible angle is determined by the points off-center, both horizontal and vertical, where the measured light intensity is fifty percent of that measured directly in front of the CRYPTOLED display. The maximum viewing angle is defined as the vertical and horizontal points where the displayed information is no longer dicernable, or interceptable for correct interpretation by (Eve) the viewer.

In other words, dicernible viewing angle refers to the angle at which spectral brightness or contrast drops below 50% of the maximum.
